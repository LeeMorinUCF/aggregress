%% -- Introduction -------------------------------------------------------------

%% - In principle "as usual".
%% - But should typically have some discussion of both _software_ and _methods_.
%% - Use \proglang{}, \pkg{}, and \code{} markup throughout the manuscript.
%% - If such markup is in (sub)section titles, a plain text version has to be
%%   added as well.
%% - All software mentioned should be properly \cite-d.
%% - All abbreviations should be introduced.
%% - Unless the expansions of abbreviations are proper names (like "Journal
%%   of Statistical Software" above) they should be in sentence case (like
%%   "generalized linear models" below).

\section[Dealing with Aggregate Data in R]{Dealing with Aggregate Data in \proglang{R}} \label{sec:intro}

% JSS Notes:
%\begin{leftbar}
%The introduction is in principle ``as usual''. However, it should usually embed
%both the implemented \emph{methods} and the \emph{software} into the respective
%relevant literature. For the latter both competing and complementary software
%should be discussed (within the same software environment and beyond), bringing
%out relative (dis)advantages. All software mentioned should be properly
%\verb|\cite{}|d. 
% 
%For writing about software JSS requires authors to use the markup
%\verb|\proglang{}| (programming languages and large programmable systems),
%\verb|\pkg{}| (software packages), \verb|\code{}| (functions, commands,
%arguments, etc.). If there is such markup in (sub)section titles (as above), a
%plain text version has to be provided in the {\LaTeX} command as well. Below we
%also illustrate how abbrevations should be introduced and citation commands can
%be employed. See the {\LaTeX} code for more details.
% \end{leftbar}


  Package \pkg{aggregress} makes adjustments to the lm object output
  when the inputted data are in aggregated form.
  That is, when the data frame has only the unique values of
  all variables and the frequencies of these observations recorded in a column of weights.
  For example, in the case of linear regression, the resulting object is indistinguishable from that from the \pkg{lm} object
  original unaggregated data.
  It includes adjustments to the statistics and diagnostics for a
  regression model. 


To quote the help files for the \code{lm} function:
``Therefore, the sigma estimate and residual degrees of freedom
may be suboptimal; in the case of replication weights, even wrong.
Hence, standard errors and analysis of variance tables should be
treated with care.''
This packages makes adjustments so that the sigma estimate and
residual degrees of freedom are not suboptimal or wrong; they are correct.



% 
There are several R packages \citep{R} available for working with aggregated data. 
% 
The packages \pkg{markovchain} \citep{pkg:markovchain} is not one of them.

% JSS Style Notes:
%% -- Manuscript ---------------------------------------------------------------
%% - In principle "as usual" again.
%% - When using equations (e.g., {equation}, {eqnarray}, {align}, etc.
%%   avoid empty lines before and after the equation (which would signal a new
%%   paragraph.
%% - When describing longer chunks of code that are _not_ meant for execution
%%   (e.g., a function synopsis or list of arguments), the environment {Code}
%%   is recommended. Alternatively, a plain {verbatim} can also be used.
%%   (For executed code see the next section.)

\section{Model} \label{sec:model}

% JSS notes:
%\begin{leftbar}
%Note that around the \verb|{equation}| above there should be no spaces (avoided
%in the {\LaTeX} code by \verb|%| lines) so that ``normal'' spacing is used and
%not a new paragraph started.
%\end{leftbar}


Is there really a model? 

It's more about what others are missing. 


Computational benefit: $O(\tilde{n})$ vs.~$O(n)$, where $n$ is the sample size and $\tilde{n}$ is the number of rows in the aggregated dataset. 
This number is defined by \code{n_tilde <- length(unique(data[, column_names))} where \code{column_names} is a character vector of the names of the depenedent and independent variables in the regression model. 


This can considerably reduce the memory requirements for estimating a model. 
This is especially true when using categorical variables, since the length of the dataset is limited by the number of permutations of the discrete dataset. 


There is a provision to categorize a continuous variable onto a discrete grid of values. 
However, it is well known that this sort of measurement error in the covariates can lead to a downward bias in the magnitude of the regression coefficients. 
To account for this, the bias correction of () is applied. 



What changes with the linear model, the linear probability model and logistic regression? 


What adjustments are made for heteroskedasticity? 


What adjustments are made for measurement error induced by aggregation? 

How can I calculate the AUROC for a logistic regression with aggregated data? 





% JSS Notes:
%% -- Illustrations ------------------------------------------------------------
%%
%% - Virtually all JSS manuscripts list source code along with the generated
%%   output. The style files provide dedicated environments for this.
%% - In R, the environments {Sinput} and {Soutput} - as produced by Sweave() or
%%   or knitr using the render_sweave() hook - are used (without the need to
%%   load Sweave.sty).
%% - Equivalently, {CodeInput} and {CodeOutput} can be used.
%% - The code input should use "the usual" command prompt in the respective
%%   software system.
%% - For R code, the prompt "R> " should be used with "+  " as the
%%   continuation prompt.
%% - Comments within the code chunks should be avoided - these should be made
%%   within the regular LaTeX text.

%But first... Examples of displaying code in JSS style. 
%
%The data can be loaded by
%%
%\begin{CodeChunk}
%\begin{CodeInput}
%R> data("quine", package = "MASS")
%\end{CodeInput}
%\end{CodeChunk}
%%
%and a basic frequency distribution of the response variable is displayed in
%Figure~\ref{fig:quine}.

%\begin{leftbar}
%For code input and output, the style files provide dedicated environments.
%Either the ``agnostic'' \verb|{CodeInput}| and \verb|{CodeOutput}| can be used
%or, equivalently, the environments \verb|{Sinput}| and \verb|{Soutput}| as
%produced by \fct{Sweave} or \pkg{knitr} when using the \code{render_sweave()}
%hook. Please make sure that all code is properly spaced, e.g., using
%\code{y = a + b * x} and \emph{not} \code{y=a+b*x}. Moreover, code input should
%use ``the usual'' command prompt in the respective software system. For
%\proglang{R} code, the prompt \code{"R> "} should be used with \code{"+  "} as
%the continuation prompt. Generally, comments within the code chunks should be
%avoided -- and made in the regular {\LaTeX} text instead. Finally, empty lines
%before and after code input/output should be avoided (see above).
%\end{leftbar}

% JSS format for figures:
%A basic frequency distribution of the response variable is displayed in
%%Figure~\ref{fig:quine}.
%
%\begin{figure}[t!]
%\centering
%\includegraphics{delete-this-image}
%\caption{\label{fig:quine} Frequency distribution for number of days absent
%from school.}
%\end{figure}


%As a first model for the \code{quine} data, we fit the basic Poisson regression
%model. (Note that JSS prefers when the second line of code is indented by two
%spaces.)
%%
%\begin{CodeChunk}
%\begin{CodeInput}
%R> m_pois <- glm(Days ~ (Eth + Sex + Age + Lrn)^2, data = quine,
%+    family = poisson)
%\end{CodeInput}
%\end{CodeChunk}
%%
%Hence, the full summary of that model is shown below.
%%
%\begin{CodeChunk}
%\begin{CodeInput}
%R> summary(m_nbin)
%\end{CodeInput}
%\begin{CodeOutput}
%Call:
%glm.nb(formula = Days ~ (Eth + Sex + Age + Lrn)^2, data = quine, 
%    init.theta = 1.60364105, link = log)
%
%Coefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities)
%            Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)    
%(Intercept)  3.00155    0.33709   8.904  < 2e-16 ***
% ...
%\end{CodeOutput}
%\end{CodeChunk}
%
%
%
%Here is another example of code:
%\begin{Code}
%glm(formula, data, subset, na.action, weights, offset,
%  family = gaussian, start = NULL, control = glm.control(...),
%  model = TRUE, y = TRUE, x = FALSE, ...)
%\end{Code}


%\begin{leftbar}
%As the synopsis above is a code listing that is not meant to be executed,
%one can use either the dedicated \verb|{Code}| environment or a simple
%\verb|{verbatim}| environment for this. Again, spaces before and after should be
%avoided.
%\end{leftbar}

A demonstration of analysis is shown in \verb|aggregress_demo.R| and it serves as an example of what a typical session of model specification, estimation and testing can include. This procedure includes the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Organizing data
\item Choosing estimation options
\item Lag selection
\item Model estimation
\item Hypothesis testing
\end{enumerate}
