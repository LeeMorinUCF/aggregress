Description: The aggregress package makes adjustments to the lm object output
  when the inputted data are in aggregated form.
  That is, when the data frame has a list of unique values of
  all variables with the frequencies recorded in a column of weights.
  The resulting object is indistinguishable from that from the
  original unaggregated data.
  It includes adjustments to the statistics and diagnostics for a
  regression model.
